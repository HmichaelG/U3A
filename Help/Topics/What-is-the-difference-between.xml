    </header>
    <para styleclass="Normal">Refunds and credits are similar in that they both reduce a member&apos;s liability to the U3A. The primary difference between the two is that a refund is the repayment of money to the member whereas a credit is the reduction in fees due.</para>
    <para styleclass="Normal">A <text style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Refund</text><text style="font-style:italic;">&#32;</text>is a negative receipt. You create a refund via <link displaytype="text" defaultstyle="true" type="topiclink" href="Add_Edit-Receipts">Add/Edit Receipts &amp; Refunds</link>. A refund is money that is returned to the member. For example, Susan enrolls in Aquarobics and pays a $50.00 course fee. She then falls ill and withdraws from the course. She will be <text style="font-style:italic;">refunded</text> the $50.00 course fee.</para>
    <para styleclass="Normal">A <text style="font-weight:bold;">C</text><text style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">redit</text> is a negative fee. You create a credit via <link displaytype="text" defaultstyle="true" type="topiclink" href="Add_Edit-Fees">Add/Edit Fees &amp; Credits</link>. A credit represents a change to the fee being charged. It does not represent money paid to your U3A. For example, Tom also enrolls in Aquarobics for which there is a $50.00 course fee. However, the enrollment is late and it is determined that he needs only pay $30.00 for the remainder of the course. A Credit of $20.00 is created to reduce the fee to $30.00. </para>
