    <para styleclass="Normal">Member Portal Maintenance Mode prevents members from accessing Member Portal functions while major restructuring of data is being undertaken. In particular, this mode should be used when you are making preparations for the new U3A year.</para>
    <para styleclass="Normal">The advantage of Maintenance Mode is that member transactions (cash receipts, enrolments etc.) do not have to be recreated in the event of a data catastrophe and database restore. You need only be concerned with the work that has been done on the administrative website.</para>
    <para styleclass="Normal">To enter Maintenance Mode, enter or confirm the approximate date and time the system will be in maintenance mode for and click the red button.</para>
    <para styleclass="Normal">To exit Maintenance Mode, re-enter this procedure. The button will now be coloured green. Again, click it to exit.</para>
